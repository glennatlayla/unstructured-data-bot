# Deployment Overview

## Overview
This document provides a high-level overview of the deployment strategy for the Unstructured Data Indexing & AI-Query Application. For detailed procedures, see the specific deployment guides.

## Deployment Architecture

### Multi-Environment Strategy
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose for rapid iteration
- **Azure Development**: VM-based deployment for testing
- **Azure Production**: AKS-based deployment for scale
- **Hybrid**: Mixed local/cloud development workflows

### Core Components
- **Container Services**: All services packaged as Docker containers
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose (local) / Kubernetes (production)
- **Infrastructure**: Azure resources managed via Bicep/CLI
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config with Key Vault integration

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Local Development
- Docker environment setup
- Service containerization
- Local testing and validation
- Development workflow establishment

### Phase 2: Azure Development
- Azure subscription provisioning
- Resource group creation
- VM-based deployment
- Remote development capabilities

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- AKS cluster deployment
- Production-grade monitoring
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization

## Key Principles

### Infrastructure as Code
- All Azure resources defined in Bicep templates
- Automated provisioning via Azure CLI scripts
- Version-controlled infrastructure configuration
- Reproducible deployments

### Security First
- Secrets managed in Azure Key Vault
- Network security groups and firewalls
- Identity-based access control
- Audit logging enabled

### Observability
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Centralized logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check endpoints

## Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Start local environment
python3 menu-workplan-execution.py
# Select option 3: Bring up containers (local)
```

### Azure Development
```bash
# Deploy to Azure VM
python3 menu-workplan-execution.py
# Select option 8: Azure Deployment Options
# Select option a: Deploy containers to Azure VM
```
