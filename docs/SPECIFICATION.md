## üéØ Executive Summary

This system indexes large, unstructured enterprise repositories (Box, SharePoint, OneDrive), applies metadata extraction and optional sensitive-data classification, and exposes natural-language Q&A via a Microsoft Teams bot and an Admin Web UI. It supports incremental scanning, durable progress tracking, rights-aware (security-trimmed) retrieval, cost visibility with forecast, and answer rendering including tables and charts.

### Key Capabilities
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Box, SharePoint, OneDrive via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
- **Intelligent Processing**: Incremental scanning, change detection, metadata extraction, AI summarization
- **Security-First Design**: Rights-aware querying, security trimming, tenant isolation, sensitive data classification
- **Enterprise Features**: Cost visibility with forecasting, audit trails, policy management, backup/restore
- **Modern Architecture**: Containerized microservices, MongoDB + Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI integration

## üéØ Goals & Scope

### Goals
- Connect to Box, SharePoint, and OneDrive at enterprise scale via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
- Traverse deep directory trees efficiently; resume and re-scan only when items change
- Create a master index (MongoDB) and a vector index (Azure AI Search) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Provide end-user Q&A in Teams; provide admin controls (policies, cost tracking, directory selection, processing controls) in a Web UI
- Ensure strong security (least privilege, tenant isolation, secrets in Key Vault) and governance (audit, PII/PHI/ITAR controls)
- Enforce per-user rights at query time (security trimming) so users only discover and retrieve data they are authorized to access

### Out of Scope
- End-user document editing
- DLP beyond the defined policy enforcement
- Non-Microsoft chat surfaces other than Teams

## üîß Component Specifications

### 5.1 Ingestion & Monitor Service

**Responsibilities**: Discovery, change detection, enqueueing, orchestration of file pipeline, poisoning/redo handling, metrics, ACL capture.

#### Directory Traversal Controller
Directory traversal operates in three modes:
- **CLI**: `python -m ingestion.traverse --tenant TENANT --source {box\|sharepoint\|onedrive} --mode {full\|incremental} [--paths "/Finance,/HR"]`
- **Scheduler**: CronJob (AKS) for periodic incremental scans (default hourly, tenant-configurable)
- **Event-driven**: Webhook/MCP event ingester maps provider change notifications to targeted re-scan queue items

#### Change Detection & ACLs
- A file is re-processed only if any of: modified_time, provider version/ETag, content hash, or ACL hash has changed
- During ingestion, the service captures provider ACLs for each item:
  - **Box**: collaborators (users/groups), roles (viewer, editor, etc.), shared link scope
  - **SharePoint/OneDrive**: inheritance, unique permissions, sharing links, role assignments
- The ACL snapshot is normalized and hashed; stored with each file record and propagated to the index

#### Throughput & Backpressure
- Work queues sized per tenant
- HPA scales workers by queue depth/latency
- Max parallelism per provider to respect API limits

### 5.2 Pre-filter & Metadata Extraction

- Normalizes provider metadata (file_id, path, size, mime, author, modified_time, permissions)
- Extracts text (Office/PDF) with progress recording
- Files are not re-scanned unless metadata values change
- Emits a canonical document for downstream summarization and embedding

### 5.3 Sensitive Data Classification & Policies

#### Admin-Configurable "Sensitive Data" Definition
Admin UI provides a policy editor to define what "sensitive data" means per tenant:
- **Categories**: PII, PCI, PHI, ITAR/EAR, Trade Secrets, Legal Privilege, HR
- **Detectors**: Enable/disable built-in regex/patterns or NLP classifiers; define custom regexes
- **Examples/Exclusions**: Provide examples and explicit exclusions
- **Enforcement**: Choose behaviors on retrieval/answer: mask, block, alert, or allow with banner

#### Optional Directory Selection
- Admins see a browsable directory tree via MCP providers
- Can select folders to prioritize classification/summarization
- Restrict Q&A scope or trigger ad-hoc re-processing

### 5.4 Summarization & Embeddings

- **Summaries**: Azure OpenAI (GPT-4-class) produces compact JSON summary with fields: title, purpose, entities, dates, table of contents, and key facts
- **Embeddings**: Azure OpenAI text-embedding model with chunking by semantic boundaries (target 1‚Äì2k tokens)
- **Index Update**: Upsert to Azure AI Search (vector + keyword) with file_id, tenant_id, path, sensitivity flags, allowed_principals/groups, and summary facets

### 5.5 Authorization (Security Trimming) & RAG Orchestration

#### Identity & Token Flow
- **Teams auth**: Bot authenticates the user with Entra ID
- **On-Behalf-Of**: Orchestrator exchanges Teams token for Microsoft Graph and SharePoint/OneDrive access
- **Box consent**: Users sign into Box via OAuth; tokens stored encrypted and rotated
- **Identity mapping**: Maintains mapping from Teams UPN ‚Üí Entra object ID/Group IDs ‚Üí provider identities

#### Security Filter Construction
- At query time, AuthZ Service resolves caller's effective principals:
  - Direct user ID for each provider
  - Group memberships
  - Special scopes from sharing links (if allowed by policy)
- Orchestrator queries Azure AI Search with security filter: return only documents where caller's principals intersect allowed_principals/allowed_groups
- Final gate: Per-item allow/deny check via AuthZ using latest provider tokens

#### Retrieval, Prompting & Rendering
- Retrieval uses security-filtered vector + keyword search
- Prompt construction includes only accessible content
- Answer rendering only includes rows from permitted items
- If question targets restricted areas: "Some requested data is restricted for your account"

#### Caching & Performance
- Per-user principal cache with short TTL (5‚Äì15 minutes)
- Index filters push down most trimming to Azure AI Search
- Final gate limited to top-k results

#### Model Registry & Intelligent Routing

**Model Registry**: Centralized catalog of available Azure OpenAI deployments with metadata:
- Endpoint, deployment name, API version
- Capabilities (vision, tools, function calling, context length)
- Performance characteristics (latency, quality, cost per token)
- Tags (model family, purpose, availability)
- Health status and rate limits

**Routing Policies**: Tenant and feature-specific model selection rules:
- Quality-focused: qa ‚Üí gpt-4o, summarize ‚Üí gpt-4o-mini
- Cost-optimized: embed ‚Üí text-embedding-3-large, chat ‚Üí gpt-35-turbo
- Capability-based: vision tasks ‚Üí gpt-4o, tool use ‚Üí gpt-4o
- Latency-sensitive: real-time chat ‚Üí gpt-35-turbo, batch processing ‚Üí gpt-4o

**Intelligent Router**: Runtime model selection based on:
- Task requirements (vision, tools, function calling)
- Quality vs. latency budget constraints
- Feature flags and A/B testing configurations
- Current model availability and health status
- Cost optimization and budget enforcement

**Usage Tracking & Budget Management**:
- Per-model usage logging with tenant, feature, and cost attribution
- Automatic downshift to cheaper models when budget caps are reached
- Real-time cost monitoring and alerting
- Performance analytics and model comparison metrics

### 5.6 Cost Metering & Forecast Service

- Exposed to Admin UI for cost visibility and budget management
- Supports cost optimization and alerting

### 5.7 Admin Web UI
