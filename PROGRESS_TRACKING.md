## Progress Tracking Rules

1. **After Each File Creation/Modification:** Update this file with details
2. **After Each Step Completion:** Update workplan-execution.v3.json status
3. **Before Starting New Work:** Verify current step and prerequisites
4. **Document All Dependencies:** Record what files/services are affected
5. **Maintain Audit Trail:** Keep clear records of what was implemented when
6. **CRITICAL: Never lose progress tracking context** - Always check PROGRESS_TRACKING.md first
7. **CRITICAL: Record every significant change immediately** - Don't wait for session end
8. **CRITICAL: Use specific file paths and detailed descriptions** - Avoid vague summaries
